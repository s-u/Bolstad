\title{Simple, Stratified and Cluster Sampling}
\usage{
sscsample(
  size,
  n.samples,
  sample.type = c("simple", "cluster", "stratified"),
  x = NULL,
  strata = NULL,
  cluster = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{size}{the desired size of the sample}

\item{n.samples}{the number of repeat samples to take}

\item{sample.type}{the sampling method. Can be one of "simple",
"stratified", "cluser" or 1, 2, 3 where 1 corresponds to "simple", 2 to
"stratified" and 3 to "cluster"}

\item{x}{a vector of measurements for each unit in the population. By
default x is not used, and the builtin data set sscsample.data is used}

\item{strata}{a corresponding vector for each unit in the population
indicating membership to a stratum}

\item{cluster}{a corresponding vector for each unit in the population
indicating membership to a cluster}
}
\value{
A list will be returned with the following components:
\item{samples}{a matrix with the number of rows equal to size and the number
of columns equal to n.samples. Each column corresponds to a sample drawn
from the population} \item{s.strata}{a matrix showing how many units from
each stratum were included in the sample} \item{means}{a vector containing
the mean of each sample drawn}
}
\description{
Samples from a fixed population using either simple random sampling,
stratitified sampling or cluster sampling.
}
\examples{

## Draw 200 samples of size 20 using simple random sampling
sscsample(20,200)

## Draw 200 samples of size 20 using simple random sampling and store the
## results. Extract the means of all 200 samples, and the 50th sample
res = sscsample(20,200)
res$means
res$samples[,50]
