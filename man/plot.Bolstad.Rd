\usage{
\method{plot}{Bolstad}(
  x,
  overlay = TRUE,
  which = c(1, 3),
  densCols = c("red", "green", "blue")[which],
  legendLoc = "topleft",
  scaleLike = FALSE,
  xlab = eval(expression(x$name)),
  ylab = "",
  main = "Shape of prior and posterior",
  ylim = c(0, max(cbind(x$prior, x$likelihood, x$posterior)[, which]) * 1.1),
  cex = 0.7,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A S3 object of class Bolstad}

\item{overlay}{if \code{FALSE} then up to three plots will be drawn 
side-by-side}

\item{which}{Control which of the prior = 1, likelihood = 2, and posterior = 
3, are plots. This is set to prior and posterior by default to retain 
compatibility with the book}

\item{densCols}{The colors of the lines for each of the prior, likelihood and
posterior}

\item{legendLoc}{The location of the legend, usually either \code{"topright"}
or \code{"topleft"}}

\item{scaleLike}{If \code{TRUE}, then the likelihood will be scaled to have
approximately the same maximum value as the posterior}

\item{xlab}{Label for x axis}

\item{ylab}{Label for y axis}

\item{main}{Title of plot}

\item{ylim}{Vector giving y coordinate range}

\item{cex}{Character expansion multiplier}

\item{\dots}{Any remaining arguments are fed to the \code{plot} command}

\description{
A unified plotting method for plotting the prior, likelihood and posterior 
from any of the analyses in the book
}
\details{
The function provides a unified way of plotting the prior, likelihood and 
posterior from any of the functions in the library that return these 
quantities. It will produce an overlay of the lines by default, or separate 
panels if \code{overlay = FALSE}.
}
\examples{

x = rnorm(20,-0.5,1)
## find the posterior density with a N(0,1) prior on mu
b = normnp(x,sigma=1)
plot(b)
plot(b, which = 1:3)
plot(b, overlay = FALSE, which = 1:3)
